        <h1 id="h2">All about Peter Ke</h1>
        <p id="h3">I was born on January 10,1999. I always wanted to be a physicist 
           but I gave up because when I research about getting a Ph.D to be a
           physicist, it was too much work. So, I decided to be a Electrical/Electronics
           engineer since it only takes 4 years to be a bachelor degree and like 1 
           more year depending on how much you work.I didn't care the fact that I switched
           interest because as long as it's based on physics and math or STEM related field
           I didn't care as much.
